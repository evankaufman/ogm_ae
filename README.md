OGM_AE - Occupancy Grid Mapping and Autonomous Exploration
===========================================================================

Some functions for probabilistic occupancy grid mapping and single-vehicle entropy-based autonomous exploration were developed by Evan Kaufman, Kuya Takami, Zhuming Ai, and Taeyoung Lee through a contract between the US Naval Research Lab and The George Washington University from April 2016 - September 2017. These initial contributions are heavily modified, and further contributions in 3D mapping, 3D exploration, and multi-vehicle cooperative autonomous exploration and patrol are extended since the NRL contract (October 2017 and beyond). This package is currently maintained by [Evan Kaufman](https://github.com/evankaufman).
